# Rebuild the national all-routes vector tiles + PMTiles archive (web/tiles/).

# ADVISORY mutation testing of the scoring math (src/scorecard_pipeline/score.py,
# metrics.py, and rt.py: the grade ladder, fix-priority tiers, deduction
# arithmetic, freshness slope, and realtime weighting — where a silent bug
# mis-grades an agency). Coverage there is already high, so this is the next
# signal: do the tests' assertions actually catch a regression? Scope + config
# live in pipeline/pyproject.toml [tool.mutmut]; the kill signal is the unit
# tests for those modules plus the property/corpus tests (about a minute).
#
# NOT part of `verify` and NEVER a per-PR blocker — REVIEW-GATE per
# CODE-QUALITY-STANDARD.md §10. Run it locally or via the weekly mutation.yml
# workflow. Baseline score + triaged survivors: docs/mutation-testing.md. Delete
# pipeline/mutants/ first for a clean-cache baseline; `mutation-results` reprints
# the last run's survivors without re-running.
