# CI Action: gate a build on feed quality

Run the scorecard inside any GitHub Actions workflow and fail the build when a
GTFS Schedule feed drops below a grade or is about to expire. This is the same
`scorecard try` gate the project uses, packaged so a vendor or agency can catch
a bad export before it ships.

## What it does

The action downloads the feed, runs the MobilityData gtfs-validator, scores it
against the rubric, and exits non-zero when a threshold you set is breached.
Nothing is published; the feed is scored in place and the result is the build's
pass or fail.

## Quick start

Add a step to a workflow. This example fails the build if a nightly export
grades below B or has under 14 days of service left:

```yaml
name: Check the GTFS feed
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 8 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  gtfs-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ChelseaKR/gtfs-scorecard@v1
        with:
          feed-url: https://example.org/gtfs/feed.zip
          name: Example Transit
          min-grade: B
          min-days-to-expiry: 14
```

`@v1` follows the latest v1 release. Pin a full version tag (`@v1.0.0`) or a
commit SHA when you want an exact, unchanging contract.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `feed-url` | yes | | Direct link to a GTFS Schedule zip. |
| `min-grade` | no | _(skip)_ | Fail if the overall grade is below this letter: A, B, C, D, or F. |
| `min-days-to-expiry` | no | _(skip)_ | Fail if the feed expires within this many days. A feed with no expiry date fails this check. |
| `name` | no | feed host | Agency name shown in the printed report. |
| `html` | no | _(skip)_ | Path to also write a standalone HTML scorecard, relative to the workspace. |
| `ref` | no | _(action version)_ | Ref of gtfs-scorecard to install the scorer from. Defaults to the version the action was called as, so `@v1` installs the v1 scorer. |

Leave a threshold blank to skip it. With neither `min-grade` nor
`min-days-to-expiry` set, the action prints the scorecard and always passes,
which is useful as an informational step.

## Saving the HTML report

Set `html` to keep the rendered scorecard as a build artifact:

```yaml
      - uses: ChelseaKR/gtfs-scorecard@v1
        with:
          feed-url: https://example.org/gtfs/feed.zip
          min-grade: C
          html: scorecard.html
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: gtfs-scorecard
          path: scorecard.html
```

The `if: always()` keeps the report even when the gate fails, which is when you
most want to read it.

## How it runs

The action is a composite that sets up Java 17 (the validator is a Java tool)
and `uv`, then runs the published `scorecard` CLI straight from this
repository with `uvx`. No separate install or container build is needed. The
first run downloads the validator jar, so expect a slower cold start and faster
warm runs.

## Notes

- This gates GTFS Schedule feeds. Realtime scoring needs sampling over a window
  and is not part of the build gate.
- Grades follow `docs/rubric.md`. If a grade looks off, read the printed
  findings: the gate reports the same categories the dashboard does.
