# Fix: the feed expires within 30 days

Code: `scorecard_feed_expiring_soon`

## What this means

The scorecard works out the last day your feed actually covers service,
taking the later of `feed_info.txt`'s `feed_end_date` and the last date any
calendar or calendar_dates entry runs service, and that day falls within the
next 30 days. The feed is not expired yet, but the window is closing.

## Why it matters

This is the early warning before [the feed has already
expired](scorecard_feed_expired.md). Once the calendar runs out, trip planners
stop showing your service to riders, with no notice to them first. Acting now,
while it is a heads-up rather than an outage, means a calm export instead of a
scramble after riders start reporting the agency missing from their app.

## How to fix it

- **Re-export the feed** with a validity window reaching further out. Most
  scheduling tools set the calendar span, or `feed_info.txt`'s
  `feed_end_date`, from a configured number of days; push it out to at least
  60 days so this stops firing.
- **Make exporting routine.** If exports happen weekly or on every schedule
  change, the end date stays comfortably ahead and this finding stops
  appearing on its own.

## How long it usually takes

One export, today. Worth doing now while it is a heads-up rather than an
outage.
