# Accessibility Conformance Report (VPAT 2.5 Rev — 508 edition)

**Name of product:** GTFS Scorecard (public website, single-page app, GitHub Action)
**Report date:** 2026-06-22
**Standard evaluated:** Revised Section 508 Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), which
incorporate **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**. The product is built and tested to **WCAG 2.2 Level
AAA** (see `docs/accessibility.md`), which exceeds this bar.

**Evaluation methods:** automated checks (`pipeline/scripts/check_contrast.py` for
contrast across every theme; axe-core and Lighthouse in CI — `.github/workflows/a11y.yml`),
plus manual keyboard and assistive-technology review. Evidence and per-criterion AAA
notes live in `docs/accessibility.md`.

## Conformance levels used

- **Supports** — meets the criterion without exception.
- **Partially Supports** — meets the criterion for the core experience, with a
  documented exception for which an equivalent accessible path exists.
- **Does Not Support** — does not meet the criterion.
- **Not Applicable** — the criterion does not apply to this product.

## Table 1 — WCAG 2.0 Level A

| Criterion | Level | Conformance | Remarks |

| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | A | Supports | Semantic landmarks, headings, `<table>`/list structure, `aria-current`, breadcrumbs. |
| 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence | A | Supports | DOM order matches reading order; no layout that reorders meaning. |
| 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics | A | Supports | Instructions never rely on shape/position/color alone. |
| 1.4.1 Use of Color | A | Supports | Grades, severities, and the active nav stop pair color with text/`aria-current`/icons. |

| 4.1.3 Status Messages | AA | Supports | `role="status"` on loading and live result counts. |

### Documented AA exceptions

- **National map (`/map/`):** the third-party MapLibre canvas is a convenience layer.
  It is `aria-hidden`, kept out of the tab order, and carries no on-canvas controls, so
  nothing focusable is hidden from assistive tech. The conformant primary on the page is
  the filterable agency table (agency, grade, state, score, link), with grade, state, and
  a "Skip to the agency list" bypass; the same grade and state filters drive the map and
  the table together, and grade is drawn as a letter on every marker, never colour alone.
  The page is axe-tested in CI like every other route (ADR 0022).
- **Equity choropleth (`/equity/`):** a static inline-SVG state choropleth of the ACS need
  tiers. Tiers are encoded by colour plus a hatch pattern and named in each state's title
  text; the priority and full per-state tables carry every number the map shows, reached by
  a "Skip to the state tables" bypass. No map library or tiles, so it is fully keyboard- and
  screen-reader-operable.

- **Per-agency route map (`/agency/<id>/`):** each scorecard draws that agency's own
  routes and stops on a MapLibre map. Here the map is purely a visual enhancement and
  is **not** an exception: the canvas is marked `aria-hidden`, carries no focusable
  controls, and is taken out of the keyboard tab order, so it adds nothing for assistive
  tech to trip over. The conformant primary is a semantic, keyboard-navigable route
  table (route name and number, vehicle type, and the line color described in words —
  never color alone) plus a stop count and full stop list, reached by a "Skip to route
  and stop data" bypass link placed before the map. The fly-to is suppressed under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. This page is in the axe/pa11y gate and passes with zero
  violations, so it Supports without a documented exception.

- **National all-routes map (`/routes/`):** every tracked agency's route shapes are
  drawn on one MapLibre canvas, read from a single PMTiles vector-tile archive. This
  is an **exploratory enhancement, not an AAA-conformant data interface**, and we do
  not claim conformance for the canvas: a national map holds millions of route
  segments and cannot be rendered as a literal data table, so there is no equivalent
  table *on this page*. The canvas is handled like the per-agency map (marked
  `aria-hidden`, no focusable controls, taken out of the tab order, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  honored) and the page itself is in the axe/pa11y gate and passes with zero violations.
  The conformant equivalents exist elsewhere and are linked prominently at the top of
  the page, with a "Skip to the accessible agency list" bypass before the map: the
  sortable, screen-reader-friendly **agencies list (`/agencies/`)**, the
  **leaderboard (`/leaderboard/`)**, and each **per-agency scorecard's route table**
  (`/agency/<id>/`), which together carry the same route, type, grade, and agency
  information in operable, semantic form. We report this page as **Partially Supports**:
  the page chrome conforms; the map widget's internal exploration does not, and is not
  the route to the data.
