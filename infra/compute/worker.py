"""Worker: score one agency per SQS message and mirror its artifacts.

Year 2 of docs/roadmap.md. Each message names one agency; the worker runs the
existing pipeline for it and uploads just that agency's artifacts to the
artifacts bucket. The worker is a thin wrapper because the pipeline is already
a filesystem CLI (ADR 0001): moving from the Actions matrix to a queue is a
packaging change, not a rewrite.

The per-agency index/rollup rebuild is deliberately not done here (workers run
concurrently and must not race a shared index). A separate collect step rebuilds
the index after the queue drains, exactly as the sharded CI workflow does.
