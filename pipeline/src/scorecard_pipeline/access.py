"""A national view of how complete agencies' accessibility data is.

The completeness category already records, per agency, what share of a feed's
stops carry ``wheelchair_boarding`` and what share of its trips carry
``wheelchair_accessible`` (see ``completeness.py`` and the accessibility
sub-score, ADR 0006). That answers the question for one agency. Disability and
accessibility advocates, and the program staff who support them, ask a different
question: across the country, how many feeds let a wheelchair user plan a trip at
all, and where are the gaps?

This module rolls the per-agency coverage up into one national picture: a
distribution across coverage bands, national and per-state averages, and the
feeds with the most complete data (encouragement) alongside how many publish no
accessibility data yet (the work to do). It is pure over the per-agency artifacts
the renderer already reads, so the artifact is reproducible and adds no per-agency
work. It changes no grade; it is a lens, framed as coverage to build on rather
than feeds to shame.

Rationale and the field-by-field accessibility mapping live in
[docs/rubric.md](../../../docs/rubric.md) and ADR 0006.
