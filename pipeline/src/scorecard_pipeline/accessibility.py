"""Accessibility-data deepening: checks that make a feed usable by everyone.

Modeled on the open-source BlinkTag gtfs-accessibility-validator and the
California Transit Data Guidelines. These checks look past whether an
accessibility field is present and ask whether the data actually serves riders
who rely on it: route colors a low-vision rider can read, stop names a screen
reader pronounces correctly, and step-free navigation inside stations.

Findings here are zero-deduction in this slice (wiring and weighting are a
separate pass); they exist to name concrete, respectful fixes. The
gtfs-validator covers structural validity of these same files.
