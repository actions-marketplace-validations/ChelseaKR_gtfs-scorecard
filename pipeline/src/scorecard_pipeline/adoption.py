"""A national view of which newer GTFS capabilities agencies actually publish.

The completeness category already records, per agency, whether a feed carries
GTFS-Flex (demand-responsive/dial-a-ride service), fare data (legacy
``fare_attributes`` or the newer Fares v2 products and leg rules), and station
modelling with GTFS-Pathways (see ``flex.py``, ``fares.py``, ``pathways.py``).
That answers the question for one agency. Programs deciding where to invest, and
anyone asking whether it is worth adding these to a feed, ask a different one:
across the country, how many feeds publish each of these newer parts of the
spec, and where?

This module rolls the per-agency detail up into one national picture: the share
of feeds publishing flexible service, fare data (and how many use Fares v2), and
accessible station paths, plus a per-state breakdown and a short sample of feeds
that already publish each. It is pure over the per-agency artifacts the renderer
already reads, so it adds no per-agency work and is safe to re-run. It changes no
grade; it is a lens on where the newer spec is spreading, framed as adoption to
encourage rather than gaps to shame.
