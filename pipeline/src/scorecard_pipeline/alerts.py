"""Expiration and regression alert digest.

The roadmap's first retention tool (docs/roadmap.md): the single most useful
thing this tool can tell a small agency is "your feed expires in N days and
trip planners are about to drop you." This reads the artifacts the pipeline
already publishes and produces a plain-language digest of two things worth
acting on now: feeds whose service window is about to close, and grades that
dropped since the previous run.

The digest is rendered as Markdown and written to stdout or a file. Routing it
to subscribers (email via SES, a Slack post) is a deploy concern handled by the
caller; keeping the build and the send separate is what makes the logic
testable against fixture artifacts with no network.
