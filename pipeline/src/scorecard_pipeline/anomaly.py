"""Catch implausible single-step shifts in an agency's score history.

A feed pipeline occasionally publishes one bad snapshot: a stale export served
for a single day scores an F, then the next day's run recovers to a B. That is
not a real regression, it is a transient glitch, and treating it as a genuine
slide would send a misleading alert to the agency. This module looks at the
dated history the scorecard already keeps (the per-agency "history" list in
index.json, oldest to newest) and points out steps that are too large or too
abrupt to be a normal day-to-day change.

This is a heads-up layer, not a verdict: every finding names what looks off and
leaves the judgement to the person reading it. Wiring it into the digest or the
site is a separate pass; here the logic stays pure and testable.
