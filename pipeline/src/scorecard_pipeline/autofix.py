"""Auto-fix layer: turn a finding into a deterministic patch.

The validator and the scorecard name what is wrong; this fixes the subset of
findings that have one unambiguous correct edit. The point is to hand an agency a
already-corrected feed for the safe cases, not to guess. So the recipes here are
deliberately conservative: each one changes only what is mechanically certain
(surrounding whitespace, shouting stop names), preserves every other byte of the
feed, and reports exactly what it touched. Anything that needs judgement (a
missing fare, an unknown wheelchair value, a real contact email) is left for the
agency, with the scorecard's plain-language fix.

The output is a patched GTFS zip plus a record of what changed, so a person can
review the diff before publishing. Wiring this into a pull request against an
agency's feed repository is a downstream step; this module produces the patch.
