"""Conformance trust mark: a pass/not-yet credential a feed can earn.

The grade is a gradient. A credential needs a bright line, so an agency can say
"this feed meets the bar" and a state program can point to one. The mark is
awarded when a feed clears three plain requirements at once, each mapped to a
thing a rider actually feels:

- Valid: no validator errors that would break a rider's trip.
- Current: the service calendar has not lapsed and is not about to.
- Accessible: the feed states wheelchair access on most stops and trips.

This extends the same checks the NTD readiness pillars and the grade already
use; it does not move any category score. The framing is a credential to earn,
never a failure to publish: a feed that misses is "not yet", with the gap named.
The accessibility floor measures what the feed publishes, not whether a stop is
physically usable.
