"""Presentation constants shared by the pipeline and the web app, exported once.

The SPA (web/src/app.js) used to hand-mirror the pipeline's presentation
vocabulary: grade bands and ranks, category labels and order, severity labels,
the stale-feed threshold, the rule-link table, and the fix-guide base URL.
Several of those carried "keep in sync" comments, and only the nav had a drift
test. This module ends the mirroring: it renders the Python definitions into
``web/src/generated/constants.js``, an ES module the app imports, so the two
languages agree by construction. ``scorecard render-constants`` refreshes the
file (``render-site`` runs it too); ``tests/test_generated_constants.py``
fails CI when the committed copy no longer matches a fresh render.

Constants whose semantics live elsewhere are imported from their home module
(``metrics.STALE_FEED_DAYS``, ``score.GRADE_BANDS``, ``site_shell``'s category
and severity labels, the ``rule_links`` table). Presentation constants that had
no single Python home before (grade order and rank, size-tier display words,
the fix-guide base URL) are defined here, and the Python renderers import them
from here for the same one-definition guarantee.
