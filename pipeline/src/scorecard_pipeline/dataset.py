"""A versioned, citable open dataset of per-agency GTFS quality.

State programs and researchers keep asking the same question: how is small-agency
GTFS doing across the country, and is it getting better? Cal-ITP publishes monthly
per-agency reports for California, but there is no live national open dataset you
can download and analyze. This module turns the published index (the same one the
web app trends from) into one flat, documented table: one row per agency, the
latest check, with category scores and expiry alongside the overall grade.

The functions here are pure over the index dict the rest of the pipeline already
produces, so the artifact is reproducible and safe to re-run:

    {"agencies": {id: {"name", "history": [
        {"date", "grade", "score", "categories": {...}, "days_until_expiry"}, ...
    ]}}}

Each history point carries category scores under "categories"; "realtime" is
absent when an agency publishes no realtime feed, and is reported as None rather
than zero so a missing feed is not mistaken for a failing one.
