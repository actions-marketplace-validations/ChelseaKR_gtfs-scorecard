"""Build the directory dataset the web app's national view reads.

At ~1,200 agencies the front door can't be a flat alphabetical list. This
turns the per-agency artifacts into one slim document the app loads once:

- a national **summary** (grade distribution, how many feeds are expiring or
  expired, the median score) so the landing screen leads with the picture,
- a **by-state** rollup so a manager can browse to their own state and a
  liaison can treat a state as a portfolio,
- per-agency **size tier** and **percentile**, so a lone letter grade reads in
  context ("better than 70% of agencies its size").

It is built at collect time from the artifacts already on disk, so it adds no
per-agency or per-shard work. State comes from each agency's Mobility Database
subdivision (resolved by the caller); size comes from the feed's stop count,
which the completeness metric already records.
