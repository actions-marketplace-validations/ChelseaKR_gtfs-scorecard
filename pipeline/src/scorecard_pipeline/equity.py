"""Equity overlay: whose riders are most exposed to bad transit data.

A data gap is not equally consequential everywhere. A feed that drops out of trip
planners hurts most where riders have the fewest alternatives: low-income areas,
households without a car, and people with disabilities (docs/expansion.md,
Phase C). This overlays American Community Survey indicators onto the scorecard so
a state program can prioritize data-quality help by need, not just by grade.

This module is the analysis core plus a thin Census fetch. It works at state
granularity, joining ACS state indicators to each agency by its state, which is
coarse but fully wireable from a handful of public ACS queries (the Census API
requires a free key, CENSUS_API_KEY — keyless requests now redirect to a
missing-key page). The
refinement to tract-level overlays (point-in-polygon of each stop against Census
tracts) is the documented escalation in ADR 0015; the classifier here is the same
shape a tract-level producer would feed.

The classifier and overlay are pure and unit-tested against fixture indicators;
fetching ACS is a thin call.
