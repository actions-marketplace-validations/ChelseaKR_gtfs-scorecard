"""Classify a feed's fare model and check that fares are actually applied.

GTFS-Fares v2 splits a fare into a product (what a rider buys) and leg rules
(which trips it applies to). A feed can publish fare products and still show
riders no fare, because nothing wires the products to any trip. That is not a
validator error, so the gtfs-validator passes it, but to a trip planner the fare
is invisible. This names the fare model and catches that published-but-not-applied
gap, framed as a fix. In this first slice the findings do not change the grade
(ADR 0008); the validator covers the structural validity of the fare files.
