"""A national view of the most common GTFS problems.

Every agency's scorecard lists that feed's findings (validator notices and the
scorecard's own plain-language checks), each already rewritten as a fix. Across
the corpus those findings answer a question no single scorecard can: what are the
most widespread GTFS problems in the country, how many feeds hit each, and what is
the one fix? This rolls the per-agency findings up into that picture, a standing
"state of GTFS quality" knowledge base that also tells each fix guide how common
its problem is.

It is pure over the findings the renderer already reads, so the artifact is
reproducible and adds no per-agency work. Prevalence is the share of tracked feeds
carrying a finding, framed as how many agencies share the same fixable problem,
never as a ranking of who is worst. It changes no grade.
