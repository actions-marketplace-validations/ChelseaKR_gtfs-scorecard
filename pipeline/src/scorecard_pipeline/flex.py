"""Detect GTFS-Flex (demand-responsive) service and report whether riders can
tell how to book it.

GTFS-Flex describes dial-a-ride, zone, and on-request service that classic GTFS
cannot. Small and rural agencies increasingly publish it, and a fixed-route lens
leaves their real operation invisible. This detects flex service and, when it is
present, checks the one thing a rider most needs: a way to book a trip. Findings
are framed as fixes, and in this first slice they do not change the grade
(ADR 0007); the value is representation and guidance, not a new penalty. The
gtfs-validator already covers the structural validity of the flex files.
