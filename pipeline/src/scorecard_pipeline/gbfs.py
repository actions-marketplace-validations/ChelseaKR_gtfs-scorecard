"""GBFS expansion: a version-currency check over the open GBFS catalog.

The scorecard's home is fixed-route GTFS, but the same agencies and the same
state programs increasingly run shared micromobility (bikeshare, scooters), which
publishes GBFS, not GTFS. The first step into that world is the cheapest useful
check: is each system's GBFS feed on a current spec version, or stuck on an old
one that modern trip planners and the MobilityData tooling no longer prefer.

MobilityData's open GBFS catalog (systems.csv) already records each system's
supported versions, so this reads currency straight from the catalog: no need to
fetch every system's discovery document. Parsing and the currency decision are
pure and unit-tested; fetching the catalog is a thin call.

References: the GBFS catalog at github.com/MobilityData/gbfs (systems.csv) and the
GBFS spec version history.
