"""Google/Apple Maps acceptance gate.

Google Transit (which also feeds Apple Maps in many regions) wants a feed to
cover at least four weeks of upcoming service from the day it is published, and
it drops feeds whose calendar has run short or expired. Once a feed's last
service date is inside that window the agency starts to fall out of trip
planners, so this is a gate worth flagging well before it bites.

This module reports forward coverage as a plain number of days and frames it as
something to fix: re-export the feed with a longer calendar before the window
closes. The narrative rationale lives in docs/rubric.md.
