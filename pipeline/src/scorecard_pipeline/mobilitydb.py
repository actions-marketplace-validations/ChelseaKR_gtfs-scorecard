"""Propose agencies.yaml entries from the Mobility Database catalog.

The roadmap's first Year 1 step (docs/roadmap.md): get a region's worth of
feeds into the registry without hand-editing YAML for each one. This reads the
Mobility Database catalog CSV (mobilitydatabase.org), filters to a country,
state, or list of providers, pairs each GTFS Schedule feed with any realtime
feeds that reference it, and emits agencies.yaml blocks.

A human still reviews and merges the output, so the registry stays curated.
The point is to remove the typing, not the judgement: key-gated realtime feeds
become an `rt_note` rather than a broken `rt_urls` entry, licenses are carried
through, and ids already present in the registry are skipped.

The catalog CSV is the stable public export of the Mobility Database; its
column names are used directly so the mapping is auditable against the source.
