"""Aggregate every agency's route shapes into one national feature collection.

Each agency run emits a per-agency ``geometry.geojson`` (see ``route_geometry``):
one deduplicated ``LineString`` per route plus that feed's stops as points. The
national all-routes map wants all of those route lines on a single canvas, so
this module gathers the route features (not the stops, which would be millions of
points and illegible at national zoom) from every agency's geometry artifact and
tags each line with the things the map needs at national scale:

- ``agency`` and ``agency_name`` so a click can link back to the scorecard,
- ``route`` (the human label) and ``type`` (Bus, Rail, ...) for the popup and
  the route-type colouring,
- ``grade`` (the agency's letter grade, from ``catalog.json``) for the alternate
  grade colouring.

The output is consumed two ways. ``write_geojsonl`` writes newline-delimited
GeoJSON for tippecanoe to turn into zoom-aware vector tiles (then a ``.pmtiles``
archive); ``feature_collection`` returns a plain ``FeatureCollection`` for tests
and for a no-tile fallback. Both are deterministic: features are ordered by
(agency id, route id) and carry no wall-clock input, so a re-run reproduces the
same bytes. The PMTiles archive tippecanoe builds is a separate, non-hermetic
step (see ``scripts/build_national_pmtiles.py``).
