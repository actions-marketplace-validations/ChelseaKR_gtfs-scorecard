"""A national time series: is GTFS data quality getting better?

Each agency's scorecard trends its own score over time. Nobody has asked the
question one level up: across the country, is transit data quality improving? The
published index already holds every agency's dated history, so this derives a
national daily series from it, with no new stored state. For each date the corpus
has seen, it carries each agency's most recent score as of that date forward and
averages, so the national line is smooth even though agencies are not all checked
on the same days.

It is pure over the index the site already trends from, so the series is
reproducible and adds no per-agency work. It reports the national average score,
the grade mix, and the share of feeds whose service had expired, per date. It
changes no grade; it is a measure of the whole, not of any one agency.
