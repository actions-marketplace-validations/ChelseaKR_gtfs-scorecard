"""Guarded HTTP fetching for untrusted feed URLs.

Feed and realtime URLs come from agencies.yaml, which Phase 4 lets outside
parties propose through the self-serve form. Fetching them with a bare
``requests.get`` is an SSRF and resource-exhaustion sink: a URL can point at
cloud metadata (169.254.169.254), an internal host, or an endpoint that streams
gigabytes. ``safe_get`` is the single choke point that every feed download goes
through. It:

- allows only http/https,
- resolves each host and rejects private, loopback, link-local, reserved,
  multicast, and unspecified addresses,
- validates every redirect hop (so a public URL can't bounce to an internal
  one), and
- caps the downloaded size.

Residual risk: a DNS-rebinding race between the resolve check and the socket
connect. The registry is curated and submissions are human-reviewed, so this is
an accepted limitation rather than a reason to pin sockets to resolved IPs.
