"""Plain-language translations of gtfs-validator notice codes.

Every translated notice answers three questions for a non-developer transit
manager: what is wrong, why a rider cares, and what to do about it. Codes
without a curated entry fall back to a readable generic line that links to
the validator's rule documentation.

Curated set: the notices small agencies hit most often, drawn from the
validator's RULES.md taxonomy. Grow this table as pilot feeds surface new
codes; never ship a metric without its explanation (CLAUDE.md quality bar).
