"""Per-subscriber feed-health email digests (the opt-in retention loop).

`alerts.py` builds the global list of feeds that need attention. This filters
that list to each opt-in subscriber's agencies and renders the email they
receive: an agency manager or a program liaison only hears from us when one of
the feeds they follow needs action, and an all-clear sends nothing.

Subscriptions live in `subscriptions.yaml` at the repo root. The build and the
send are kept separate (as alerts.py is): everything here is pure and testable
against fixture artifacts; the actual SES send is a thin, lazily-imported
function so the core needs no AWS dependency.
