"""Populate agency NTD IDs from the Transitland Atlas crosswalk.

ADR 0016 added an `ntd_id` to the registry and a check that an agency's
`agency_id` matches it, but the check can only run where we know the NTD ID, and
we curated that only for the two pilots. The Transitland Atlas
(github.com/transitland/transitland-atlas, CC-BY) records `us_ntd_id` on its US
operators and links each operator to its feeds, so it is an open join from a
feed to its five-digit NTD ID. This turns that into a one-time, reviewable
population of `ntd_id` across the registry.

The join key is the feed's static URL: each Atlas feed carries a
`urls.static_current`, and each operator carries `us_ntd_id` plus the Onestop IDs
of its feeds. We map every feed URL to its operator's NTD ID, then match our
registry's `static_gtfs_url` against it. A URL that the Atlas links to more than
one NTD ID (a shared regional feed) is dropped rather than guessed, so we never
assign one agency the NTD ID of a feed it shares. The matching functions are pure
over parsed Atlas documents and the registry, so they are testable without the
network; only `fetch_atlas` reaches out.
