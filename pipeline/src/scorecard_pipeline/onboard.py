"""Self-serve instant onboarding: score a feed from a GitHub issue.

The registry submission flow (submit.html) is curated and asks a person to merge
a pull request before a feed is scored. This is the other half: a rider, agency
staffer, or liaison who just wants to see a grade now, without waiting for a
review or learning what YAML is.

The flow is serverless by way of GitHub Actions, the same compute the daily run
uses. A web page deep-links to a pre-filled issue form; a workflow scores the
submitted URL with ``scorecard try`` and posts the scorecard back as a comment.
This module owns the two pure pieces that flow needs: reading the feed URL and
name out of the rendered issue form, and rendering the scored artifact as a
plain-language comment. The issue body is untrusted input, so the parser only
accepts an http(s) URL and never executes anything.
