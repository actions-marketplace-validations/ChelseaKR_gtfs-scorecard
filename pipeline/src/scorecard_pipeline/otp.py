"""Routing QA against OpenTripPlanner: do sample trips actually plan?

The router-free checks (routability.py) catch trips with no leg and stops with no
service. The full check the expansion plan describes loads the feed into
OpenTripPlanner and asserts that real origin-to-destination trips return
itineraries (ADR 0014). OTP is a heavy Java service, so it runs as an optional,
gated step, not on every feed; this module is the pure glue around it.

It picks origin/destination stop pairs that span the service area, builds OTP plan
requests, parses the responses, and decides pass or fail: did the sampled trips
route. The selection, request building, parsing, and the verdict are pure and
unit-tested; talking to a live OTP instance is a thin call.
