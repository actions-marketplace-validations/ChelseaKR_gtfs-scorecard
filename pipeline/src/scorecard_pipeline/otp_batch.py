"""Weekly OTP routing-QA batch: which feeds to test, and the batch verdict.

otp.py answers "do sampled trips route" for one feed against one OpenTripPlanner
instance. The weekly batch (ADR 0014, expansion plan item "trip-plannability at
sample scale") asks that question for a handful of feeds without a hosted OTP:
CI builds a throwaway containerized OTP per feed. This module is the pure half
of that batch — pick which feeds are worth the container spin-up, and aggregate
the per-feed verdicts — mirroring how otp.py keeps the live HTTP call thin.

The selection takes the same published index the rankings and the open dataset
read from (dataset.build_quality_dataset), so "best" and "worst" here mean
exactly what the national pulse page means by them. Best feeds catch a router
regression that scores miss (a top-graded feed that cannot plan a trip is the
sharpest possible signal); worst feeds show whether the grade actually predicts
a rider's experience. Everything here is pure over dicts and dataclasses, and
unit-tested; the CLI and workflow own all IO.
