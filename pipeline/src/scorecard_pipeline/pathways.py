"""Detect station pathways and levels, and the step-free routes inside a station.

GTFS pathways and levels describe how a rider moves through a station: the
walkways, stairs, escalators, elevators, and fare gates connecting entrances,
platforms, and levels. For a multi-level station or a shared hub this is how a
trip planner routes someone inside, and how a wheelchair user learns whether a
step-free (elevator) route exists.

This is relevant only to feeds that model stations. A flat stop-only feed, which
is most small and rural agencies, is complete as is and is never flagged. In this
first slice the findings do not change the grade (ADR 0009); the gtfs-validator
covers the structural validity of the pathways graph.
