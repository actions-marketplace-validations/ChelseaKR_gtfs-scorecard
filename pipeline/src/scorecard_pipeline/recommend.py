"""Recommendations beyond the grade.

The four scored categories drive the letter grade. These checks surface
opportunities that the grade deliberately does not move yet — Fares v2 (rider
categories, fare media, tap-to-pay), GTFS-Flex completeness for demand-response
service, and the deeper accessibility fields (route-color contrast, screen-reader
stop names, station pathways). They are computed at score time because they read
the GTFS file, which the renderer does not have, and attached to the artifact as
a separate `recommendations` block so they never change a category score.

Each check is isolated: one failing or absent file must not break a score, so a
check that raises is skipped with a warning rather than aborting the run.
