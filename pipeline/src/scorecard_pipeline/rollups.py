"""Program rollup artifacts: a portfolio view across many agencies.

The roadmap's view for the second core user (docs/roadmap.md): a district
liaison or statewide program staffer supports many agencies and wants one
screen sorted by what needs attention, with the same fix-framed language the
per-agency page uses. Rollups are computed from the published artifacts and
written as static JSON, exactly like everything else the web app reads.

Rollups are defined in an optional rollups.yaml at the repo root (named groups
with explicit member ids, or `all: true`). With no config file, a single
"all tracked agencies" rollup is produced, so the feature works the moment a
second agency exists.
