"""Routing-flavored QA: can a rider actually use this feed?

Structural validation can pass on a feed a rider still can't travel on. The
expansion plan's routing check (docs/expansion.md, Phase C) loads a feed into
OpenTripPlanner and asserts sample trips return itineraries. OTP is a heavy Java
service to stand up per feed, so this is the serverless tier: two router-free
checks that catch the most common "validates but unusable" breakage, with OTP as
the documented escalation (ADR 0014).

- Single-stop trips: a trip with fewer than two stop_times has no leg a rider
  can board and alight, so it carries no actual service.
- Orphan stops: a boardable stop that no trip ever serves shows up in trip
  planners and on the map, but a rider can never catch anything there.

Both are zero-deduction (ADR pattern shared with flex and pathways): they name a
concrete usability gap without moving the grade, since the rubric weights are a
separate decision. The checks are pure over the feed's tables and unit-tested.
