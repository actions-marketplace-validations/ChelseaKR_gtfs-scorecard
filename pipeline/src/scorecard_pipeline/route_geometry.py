"""Per-agency route and stop geometry for the scorecard map.

The national map (geo.py) places each agency as a single point; an agency's own
scorecard wants more: the lines its buses actually run and the stops riders wait
at, drawn from that feed's own ``shapes.txt`` and ``stops.txt``.

A GTFS feed describes geometry once per *trip*, so a route that runs hundreds of
trips a day repeats the same handful of shapes hundreds of times. Plotting all of
them is wasteful and illegible. This module deduplicates to **one representative
LineString per route_id**: of the distinct shapes a route's trips use, it keeps
the longest (the shape that traces the most of the route), which is the standard
GTFS-route-shapes reduction. Each line is simplified (Ramer-Douglas-Peucker) and
its coordinates rounded to five decimals (~1 m) so the per-agency artifact stays
a few tens of kilobytes, not megabytes.

Output is one GeoJSON ``FeatureCollection`` mixing route ``LineString`` features
and stop ``Point`` features, distinguished by a ``kind`` property, plus a compact
``summary`` (the route list, with colors and human labels, and the stop count)
that feeds the page's accessible route table without re-parsing the GeoJSON.

Degradation is graceful: a feed with stops but no usable ``shapes.txt`` yields a
stops-only map; a feed with neither yields ``None`` and the page shows no map.
Everything is derived from the feed bytes with no wall-clock input, so a re-run
reproduces the artifact byte-for-byte.
