"""High-cadence realtime archiving: the bridge from the cron to a worker fleet.

The cron monitor (rt_health.py) takes a small burst every few hours. The
expansion plan's continuous monitoring polls every feed on the spec's 20-60s
cadence, which the Cal-ITP archiver does with an always-on worker fleet (ADR
0012). This module is the runnable middle: a bounded archiving *session* that
polls a feed at the spec cadence for a fixed window inside one timed run, writing
a high-resolution observation per poll round. A ten-minute session at 20 seconds
is thirty observations, far finer than the cron, and it runs in a single Actions
job with no fleet to operate.

The session schedule is pure and unit-tested; the polling reuses the existing
realtime sampler, and each round is summarized with the same rt_health code, so a
later worker-fleet producer writes the identical record shape.
