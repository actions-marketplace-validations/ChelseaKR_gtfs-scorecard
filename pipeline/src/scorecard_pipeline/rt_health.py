"""Longitudinal realtime health: uptime and freshness over time.

The realtime category scores one sampling window per daily run. That answers
"how is the feed right now", not "how reliable has it been". No canonical tool
tracks GTFS-Realtime over time (docs/expansion.md, Phase B), so this adds the
missing longitudinal layer: a lightweight monitor that captures a short burst on
a schedule and appends one small observation per run to a per-agency record. From
that record it reports uptime and median header lag over the window.

This is the serverless tier of national realtime monitoring. It runs on a GitHub
Actions cron rather than a continuous worker fleet (ADR 0012): a cron cannot poll
on the spec's 30-60s cadence, so each run takes a small in-run burst and the
record accumulates coverage across runs. The escalation to a worker fleet is
documented, not built, until the agency count and cadence demand it.

Pure observation and summary are unit-tested; the sampling and file I/O are thin.
