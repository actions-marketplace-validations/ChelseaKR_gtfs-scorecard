"""Authoritative-rule links for scorecard findings.

The scorecard wraps the canonical MobilityData gtfs-validator and adds a
plain-language scoring layer on top. The Cal-ITP / state-DOT audience already
works from the canonical GTFS Validator rules and GTFS Best Practices (the
California statewide GTFS quality reports are structured around exactly those),
so every finding earns credibility by pointing back to its authoritative rule.

This module is the single source of truth for that finding -> rule mapping. It
keys each finding code the scorecard renders a fix page for to one of three
authorities:

- ``VALIDATOR`` — a canonical gtfs-validator notice. The scorecard's code is
  the validator's own notice code, so the link is built deterministically from
  it. A few scorecard-computed findings re-detect a validator concept under a
  scorecard code; those carry the canonical notice in ``canonical`` so the
  audience recognises the alias.
- ``BEST_PRACTICE`` — a GTFS Best Practices recommendation, for scorecard
  completeness checks the validator does not flag (a present-but-empty field is
  valid GTFS, just poorer rider experience).
- ``REFERENCE`` — the GTFS Schedule reference section that defines the field,
  used where no Best Practice states the expectation but the spec field does.

Findings with no honest mapping are left out of the table rather than linked to
a tenuous one. ``docs/decisions/0024-validator-rule-links.md`` records why and
how each URL was verified; ``tests/test_rule_links.py`` keeps the table
well-formed.
