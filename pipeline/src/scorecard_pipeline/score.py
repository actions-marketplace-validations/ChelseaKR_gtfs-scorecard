# change apart from a rule change and see exactly when each rubric version took

# the commit that introduced each). Prepend a new entry whenever the rubric, its
# weights, deductions, grade bands, or what it measures change.
#
# A VALIDATOR_VERSION bump (validate.py) is a methodology change too: run
# `scorecard canary --candidate-version <X.Y.Z>` (or the validator-canary.yml
# workflow) first, attach its impact report to the bump PR, and prepend the
# dated entry the report generates — "Validator X→Y: median score …, N of M
# sampled agencies changed grade band, driven by <code>." — so the observed
# national effect ships with the change (canary.py, docs/rubric.md "Governed
# upgrades").
