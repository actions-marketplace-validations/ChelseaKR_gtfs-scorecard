"""Rubric weight sensitivity: would the letters survive different judgment calls?

The category weights (score.py:CATEGORY_WEIGHTS, 35/20/25/20) are judgment
calls, honestly documented in docs/rubric.md — but their *consequences* are
not: nobody can see whether the national grade picture is an artifact of that
split or robust to it. This measures it (FIX-07): rescore the latest national
snapshot under one-at-a-time weight perturbations (each category ±20%,
renormalized) and report the share of agencies whose letter grade changes
under each, plus the overall maximum churn. Publishing the result extends the
project's "reproduce or contest the grade" stance to the weights themselves.

It is pure over the published index the site already trends from (each
agency's latest per-category scores ride on its history entries), so the study
is reproducible and adds no per-agency work. It changes no grade; it measures
how stable the grades are. Run via ``scorecard sensitivity``, which publishes
data/artifacts/sensitivity.json; the how-to-read page surfaces the headline.
