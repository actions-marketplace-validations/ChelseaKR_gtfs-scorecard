"""Turn a self-serve submission into a reviewable pull request.

The roadmap's Year 1 onboarding path (docs/roadmap.md): an agency or a liaison
submits a feed URL through a short web form, and instead of asking them to learn
YAML, a small serverless function opens a pull request that adds the
agencies.yaml block. A human still reviews and merges, so nothing reaches the
live scorecard unvetted.

This module is the pure core of that function: it validates the form with the
same rules the registry loader uses (so a bad submission is rejected with one
sentence, not a broken PR), renders the block in the registry's style, and
returns everything the GitHub side needs. Keeping it here means it is covered
by the pipeline test suite and shares one definition of "valid agency" with the
daily pipeline. The serverless handler in infra/submit just calls
build_submission and talks to the GitHub API.
