"""Freshness sweep: refresh the time-based freshness category between full scores.

Freshness is a pure function of a feed's calendar dates and today's date (see
metrics.freshness), so once a feed has been fetched and scored, its expiry
countdown can be recomputed cheaply without re-downloading or re-validating.

Why this exists: the classic small-agency failure is a feed that silently
expires. A full score runs the Java validator and is comparatively expensive, so
if it is delayed or skipped (the kind of gap that let a feed's expiry go
unnoticed for a couple of days), the published expiry clock goes stale with it.
This sweep is cheap and has no network or Java dependency, so it can run far more
often and keep the expiry countdown and grade current on its own.

It carries forward the last full score's correctness, completeness, and realtime
(those need a re-fetch to change) and recomputes only freshness for the sweep
date, then re-derives the overall grade and top fixes the same way scoring does.
The result is written as a new dated artifact marked `recompute`, so it never
rewrites a past snapshot's freshness (which must stay fixed at that snapshot's
date) and trend history stays honest.
