"""Vendor view: expiry status aggregated by the host that serves each feed.

The finding a statewide program acts on is rarely about one agency. When most
of the stale feeds in a cohort sit behind a single hosting vendor, the fix is
one upstream conversation, not dozens of agency calls. This rolls the freshness
status up by feed host so that pattern is visible.

This is an operator's view, printed for whoever supports the agencies. It is
deliberately not rendered into the public site: it points at where to spend
support time, and must never read as a vendor leaderboard or a public ranking.
