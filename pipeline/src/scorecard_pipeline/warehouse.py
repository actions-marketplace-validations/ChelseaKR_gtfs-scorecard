"""Cross-agency query layer over the published data (ADR 0013).

The static API serves the bounded cross-agency endpoints. The next tier, for
arbitrary filters and joins, is a query engine over the same artifacts, not an
always-on database. DuckDB is that engine: embedded, no server, and it reads JSON
and writes Parquet directly, so a query runs against the published dataset in
process and pays nothing when idle.

This module loads the dataset rows into an in-memory DuckDB table named
``agencies`` and runs SQL against it, and exports the same rows as Parquet so a
DuckDB or Athena consumer can query the national table without this code at all.
DuckDB is an optional dependency (the ``query`` extra); the core pipeline never
imports it, and these functions raise a clear error if it is missing.

The row-shaping is pure and unit-tested; the engine calls are thin.
