"""Frozen mini-corpus canary: exact grades for ten representative feeds (FIX-05).

Each entry is a small frozen input (validator report + feed dates; two entries
add a synthetic realtime window) scored end-to-end through build_scorecard.
The expected overall score and letter grade are asserted as literals, so a
change to any deduction constant, weight, band, or the renormalization shows
up here as an exact diff — a cheap cross-module regression canary.

One entry ("unitrans-trimmed") scores the repo's real trimmed feed fixture;
the rest freeze the report/date shapes the pipeline actually produces, spanning
every grade band. If a rubric change is intentional, update these literals in
the same commit and prepend a METHODOLOGY_CHANGELOG entry (score.py).
