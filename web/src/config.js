// mirror only refreshes from the daily job's S3 sync, so a manual artifact fix
// (or any push) would not reach it and the app would serve stale data. Pages is
// updated by every deploy, so the app and the published data never drift. To
// re-enable the CDN, set this back to the CloudFront origin; the daily job keeps
// it in sync.
